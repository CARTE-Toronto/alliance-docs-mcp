## Introduction

Scholars in the **Humanities and Social Sciences** (**HSS**) are using increasingly complex computational tools, methods, and techniques in their research. There are three elements of the current landscape that place the HSS in a position for rapid growth:

- increasing open source data;
- increasing access to significant computing power and tools; and
- growing research computing competency among humanities researchers.

To support researchers in the HSS, the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en) has a dedicated team of professionals. For more information, please contact the HSS Team using the [support email address found on this page](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Technical_support#Ask_support "support email address found on this page"){.wikilink}, adding ***(HSS)*** at the beginning of the subject. Alternatively, you are welcome to request a specific staff member, consult the list of names below to find the appropriate person to contact.
