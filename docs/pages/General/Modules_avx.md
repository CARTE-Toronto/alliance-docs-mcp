Cell Ranger 1.2 and later support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v1 and v2 reagent kits, whereas Cell Ranger 1.1 and earlier do not support v2 libraries. Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines: - cellranger mkfastq wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and to convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files. - cellranger count takes FASTQ files from cellranger mkfastq and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting. - cellranger aggr aggregates outputs from multiple runs of cellranger count, normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data. - cellranger reanalyze takes gene-barcode matrices produced by cellranger count or cellranger aggr and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings. These pipelines combine Chromium-specific algorithms with the widely used RNA-seq aligner STAR. Output is delivered in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5 and HTML formats that are augmented with cellular information.

Our software takes a set of reads that have been multi-mapped to the transcriptome (where multiple alignments per read were reported) and hierarchically clusters the transcripts based on the proportion of shared reads and expression patterns. It will report the clusters and gene-level counts for each sample, which are easily tested for differential expression with count based tools such as edgeR and DESeq.

People usually use spreadsheet software like MS Excel to process table data. However this is all by clicking and typing, which is not automated and is time-consuming to repeat, especially when you want to apply similar operations with different datasets or purposes. You can also accomplish some CSV/TSV manipulations using shell commands, but more code is needed to handle the header line. Shell commands do not support selecting columns with column names either. csvtk is convenient for rapid data investigation and also easy to integrate into analysis pipelines. It could save you lots of time in (not) writing Python/R scripts. Homepage: https://github.com/shenwei356/csvtk URL: https://github.com/shenwei356/csvtk

It includes a parameter sampler allowing its integration into Bayesian or likelihood parameter estimation procedure. fastsimcoal can handle very complex evolutionary scenarios including an arbitrary migration matrix between samples, historical events allowing for population resize, population fusion and fission, admixture events, changes in migration matrix, or changes in population growth rates. The time of sampling can be specified independently for each sample, allowing for serial sampling in the same or in different populations.

It implements methods using probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs). Compared to BLAST, FASTA, and other sequence alignment and database search tools based on older scoring methodology, HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and more able to detect remote homologs because of the strength of its underlying mathematical models. In the past, this strength came at significant computational expense, but in the new HMMER3 project, HMMER is now essentially as fast as BLAST.

This method continues to refine the observation made in the IMPUTE2 method, that accuracy is optimized via use of a custom subset of haplotypes when imputing each individual. It achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT). By using the PBWT data structure at genotyped markers, IMPUTE 5 identifies locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state segments. The method then uses the selected haplotypes as conditioning states within the IMPUTE model.

At present, it works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length at an error rate ~15%. Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format. On limited test data sets, minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners. It will replace BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment.

QCA separates the API from the implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly depending on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without even needing to recompile the application! QCA should work everywhere Qt does, including Windows/Unix/MacOSX.

Salmon achieves is accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the use of quasi-mapping (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments), and massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference. The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely into many differnt pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use of our quasi-mapping algorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an unsorted BAM file produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same wicked-fast, state-of-the-art inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment.

Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This project describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations. Homepage: https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/ URL: https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/

SSW library provides an API that can be flexibly used by programs written in C, C++ and other languages. We also provide a software that can do protein and genome alignment directly. Current version of our implementation is ~50 times faster than an ordinary Smith-Waterman. It can return the Smith-Waterman score, alignment location and traceback path (cigar) of the optimal alignment accurately; and return the sub-optimal alignment score and location heuristically.

A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is that it carries out cell-based calculations, computing the Voronoi cell for each particle individually. It is particularly well-suited for applications that rely on cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg. volume, centroid, number of faces) can be used to analyze a system of particles.

It has two major components: - A XML parsing library. The parser was designed to be a useful tool in the extraction and analysis of data in the context of scientific computing, and thus the priorities were efficiency and the ability to deal with very large XML files while maintaining a small memory footprint. The most complete programming interface is based on the very successful SAX (Simple API for XML) model, although a partial DOM interface and a very experimental XPATH interface are also present. - A library (xmlf90-wxml) that facilitates the writing of well-formed XML, including such features as automatic start-tag completion, attribute pretty-printing, and element indentation. There are also helper routines to handle the output of numerical arrays. Homepage: https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/ URL: https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/ Keyword:tools
