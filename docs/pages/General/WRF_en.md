[WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) is a \"Weather Research and Forecasting\" program from the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). This software is available as the module `wrf` on our clusters. A good tutorial on the use of this software on our clusters can be found [here](https://wiki.math.uwaterloo.ca/fluidswiki/index.php?title=WRF_Tutorial).
