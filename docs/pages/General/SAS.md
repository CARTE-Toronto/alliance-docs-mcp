SAS is a statistical analysis suite developed by the SAS Institute. SAS is commercial software so users must supply their own license to run this software on Compute Canada clusters. Due to licensing restrictions, the software must be installed locally, in a user's personal directory, rather than centrally. Given the constraints of a cluster environment, it is recommended that users restrict themselves to the use of SAS in a command line environment by means of the option -nodms.
