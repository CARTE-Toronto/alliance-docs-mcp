## Introduction

The Distributed Debugging Tool (DDT) is a powerful commercial debugger with a graphical user interface (GUI). It's main intended use is for debugging parallel MPI codes, though it can also be used with serial, threaded (OpenMP / pthreads), and GPU (CUDA; also mixed MPI and CUDA) programs. The product was developed by Allinea (U.K.). It is installed on Graham cluster. The DDT software page can be found [here](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/ARM_software).

DDT supports C, C++, and Fortran 77 / 90 / 95 / 2003. Detailed documentation (the User Guide) is available as a PDF file on Graham, in

`${EBROOTALLINEA}/doc`

(One has to load the corresponding module first; see below.)

## Preparing your program {#preparing_your_program}

The code has to be compiled with the switch -g, which tells the compiler to generate symbolic information required by any debugger. Normally, all optimizations have to be turned off. For example,

`f77 -g -O0 -o program program.f`

`mpicc -g -O0 -o code code.c`

For CUDA code, you can first compile the CUDA part (\*.cu files) using nvcc,

`nvcc -g -G -c cuda_code.cu`

and then link with the non-CUDA part of the code, using cc for serial

`cc -g main.c cuda_code.o -lcudart`

or mpicc for mixed MPI/CUDA code:

`mpicc -g main.c cuda_code.o -lcudart`

## Launching DDT {#launching_ddt}

DDT is a GUI application, so one has to set up the environment properly to run X-windows (graphical) applications on Graham:

- Microsoft Windows: use free [mobaxterm app](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Connecting_with_MobaXTerm)
- Linux / Unix: nothing to install
- Mac: install a free app [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)

In all cases, add \"-Y\" to all your ssh commands, for X11 tunelling.

DDT is an interactive GUI application, so before using it one has to first allocate a compute node (or nodes) with salloc, e.g.

`salloc -A account_name --x11 --time=0-3:00 --mem-per-cpu=4G --ntasks=4  (for CPU codes)`\
`salloc -A account_name --x11 --time=0-3:00 --mem-per-cpu=4G --ntasks=1 --gres=gpu:1  (for GPU codes)`

Once the resource becomes available, load the corresponding DDT module:

`module load allinea-cpu  , or`\
`module load allinea-gpu`

For MPI codes, one also has to execute the following command:

`export OMPI_MCA_pml=ob1`

or else the Message queue display feature will not work.

To debug a code, simply type

`ddt program [optional arguments]`

After a couple of seconds, you will be presented with the following window:

## User interface {#user_interface}

DDT uses a tabbed-document interface. Each component of DDT is a dockable window, which may be dragged around by a handle. Components can also be double-clicked, or dragged outside of DDT, to form a new window. Some of the user-modified parameters and windows are saved by right-clicking and selecting a save option in the corresponding window (Groups; Evaluations; Breakpoints etc).

DDT also has the ability to load and save all these options concurrently to minimize the inconvenience in restarting sessions. Saving the session stores such things as process groups, the contents of the Evaluate window and more. When DDT begins a session, source code is automatically found from the information compiled in the executable.

The \"Find\" and \"Find In Files\" dialogs are found from the \"Search\" menu. The \"Find\" dialog will find occurrences of an expression in the currently visible source file. The \"Find In Files\" dialog searches all source and header files associated with your program and lists the matches in a result box. Click on a match to display the file in the main Source Code window and highlight the matching line.

DDT has a \"Goto line\" function which enables the user to go directly to a line of code (in the \"Search\" menu, or *Ctrl-G*).

## Controlling Program Execution {#controlling_program_execution}

- Process Control And Process Groups:
  - Ability to group many process together, with a one-click access to the whole group
  - Three predefined groups: All, Root, Workers. (Newest DDT versions only have one group - All).
  - Groups can be created, deleted, or modified by the user at any time

![](ddt_wiki2.png "ddt_wiki2.png")

- Starting, Stopping And Restarting A Program
  - Session Control dialog
- Stepping Through A Program
  - Play/Continue, Pause, Step Into, Step Over, Step Out
- Setting Breakpoints
  - All breakpoints are listed under the breakpoints tab.
  - You can suspend, jump to, delete, load or save breakpoints.
  - Breakpoints can easily be made conditional:

- Synchronizing Processes in a Group
  - \"Run to here\" command (right mouse click)

  - Moving (Down / Up / Bottom Stack Frame)
  - Aligning of stacks for parallel codes (Ctrl-A)
- Viewing Stacks in Parallel

  - SIGPIPE (Broken Pipe)
  - SIGILL (Illegal Instruction)
- To enable FPE handling, extra compiler options are required:
  - Intel: -fp0

## Debugging OpenMP programs {#debugging_openmp_programs}

- The current version of DDT has almost the same OpenMP functionality as for MPI:
  - Single click access to threads
  - Viewing stacks in parallel
  - Setting thread-specific breakpoints
  - Compare expressions across threads, etc

## Debugging GPU programs {#debugging_gpu_programs}

- Compilation instructions were [given earlier](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/#Preparing_your_program "given earlier"){.wikilink}.
- Can be a mixed MPI/CUDA code, but can only use one CPU and one GPU per node, up to 8 nodes.
