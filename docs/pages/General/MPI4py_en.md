[MPI for Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides Python bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, allowing Python applications to exploit multiple processors on workstations, clusters and supercomputers. \_\_FORCETOC\_\_

# Available versions {#available_versions}

`mpi4py` is available as a module, and not from the [wheelhouse](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Available_Python_wheels "wheelhouse"){.wikilink} as typical Python packages are. You can find available version with

and look for more information on a specific version with

where `X.Y.Z` is the exact desired version, for instance `4.0.0`.

# Famous first words: Hello World {#famous_first_words_hello_world}

1\. Run a short [interactive job](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Running_jobs#Interactive_jobs "interactive job"){.wikilink}. `<your account>`{=html} \--ntasks5}}

2\. Load the module.

3\. Run a Hello World test.

In the case above, two nodes (`node1` and `node3`) were allocated, and the jobs were distributed across the available resources.

# mpi4py as a package dependency {#mpi4py_as_a_package_dependency}

Often `mpi4py` is a dependency of another package. In order to fulfill this dependency :

1\. Deactivate any Python virtual environment.

`<b>`{=html}Note:`</b>`{=html} If you had a virtual environment activated, it is important to deactivate it first, then load the module, before reactivating your virtual environment.

2\. Load the module.

3\. Check that it is visible by `pip`

`grepÂ mpi4py`

\|result= mpi4py 4.0.0 }} and is accessible for your currently loaded python module.

If no errors are raised, then everything is OK!

4\. [Create a virtual environment and install your packages](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Python#Creating_and_using_a_virtual_environment "Create a virtual environment and install your packages"){.wikilink}.

# Running jobs {#running_jobs}

You can run mpi jobs distributed across multiple nodes or cores. For efficient MPI scheduling, please see:

- [MPI job](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Running_jobs#MPI_job "MPI job"){.wikilink}
- [Advanced MPI scheduling](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Advanced_MPI_scheduling "Advanced MPI scheduling"){.wikilink}

## CPU

1\. Write your python code, for instance, broadcasting a numpy array.

The example above is based on the [mpi4py tutorial](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#running-python-scripts-with-mpi).

2\. Write your submission script. `<tabs>`{=html} `<tab name="Distributed">`{=html}

`</tab>`{=html}

`<tab name="Whole nodes">`{=html}

`</tab>`{=html} `</tabs>`{=html}

3\. Test your script.

Before submitting your job, it is important to test that your submission script will start without errors. You can do a quick test in an [interactive job](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Running_jobs#Interactive_jobs "interactive job"){.wikilink}.

4\. Submit your job to the scheduler.

## GPU

1\. From a login node, download the demo example.

The example above and others, can be found in the [demo folder](https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py/tree/master/demo).

2\. Write your submission script.

3\. Test your script.

Before submitting your job, it is important to test that your submission script will start without errors. You can do a quick test in an [interactive job](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Running_jobs#Interactive_jobs "interactive job"){.wikilink}.

4\. Submit your job

# Troubleshooting

## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'mpi4py\' {#modulenotfounderror_no_module_named_mpi4py}

If `mpi4py` is not accessible, you may get the following error when importing it: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mpi4py'`

Possible solutions:

- check which Python versions are compatible with your loaded mpi4py module using `module spider mpi4py/X.Y.Z`. Once a compatible Python module is loaded, check that `python -c 'import mpi4py'` works.
- load the module before activating your virtual environment: please see the [mpi4py as a package dependency](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/MPI4py#mpi4py_as_a_package_dependency "mpi4py as a package dependency"){.wikilink} section above.
