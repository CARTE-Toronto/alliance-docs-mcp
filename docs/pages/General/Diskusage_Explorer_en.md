## Content of folders {#content_of_folders}

`<span style="color:red">`{=html}Warning: This tool is currently only available on [Rorqual](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Rorqual/en "Rorqual"){.wikilink} and [Narval](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Narval/en "Narval"){.wikilink}.`</span>`{=html}

You can get a breakdown by folder of how the disk space is being consumed in your /home, /scratch and /project spaces. That information is currently updated once a day and is stored in an [SQLite](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/SQLite "SQLite"){.wikilink} format for fast access.

Here is how to explore your disk consumption, using the example of /project space `def-professor` as the particular directory to investigate.

### ncurse user interface {#ncurse_user_interface}

Choose a /project space you have access to and want to analyze; for the purpose of this discussion we will use `def-professor`.

This command loads a browser that shows the resources consumed by all files under any directory tree. ![using\|450px\|frame\|left\| Navigating your project space with duc\'s ncurse tool](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Ncurse_duc.png "using|450px|frame|left| Navigating your project space with duc's ncurse tool")\

Type `c` to toggle between consumed disk space and the number of files, `q` or `<esc>`{=html} to quit and `h` for help.

If you are only interested in a subdirectory of this /project space and do not want to navigate the whole tree in the ncurse user interface, use

A complete manual page is available with the `man duc` command.

### Graphical user interface {#graphical_user_interface}

Note that when the login node is especially busy or if you have an especially large number of files in your /project space, the graphical interface mode can be slow and choppy. For a better experience, you can read the section below to run `diskusage_explorer` on your own machine.

Note that we recommend the use of the standard text-based ncurse mode on our cluster login nodes but `diskusage_explorer` does also include a nice graphical user interface (GUI).

First, make sure that you are connected to the cluster in such a way that [SSH](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/SSH "SSH"){.wikilink} is capable of correctly displaying GUI applications. You can then use a graphical interface by means of the command,

You can navigate the folders with the mouse and still type `c` to toggle between the size of the files and the number of files.

### Browse faster on your own machine {#browse_faster_on_your_own_machine}

First, [install the diskusage_explorer software](http://duc.zevv.nl/#download) on your local machine and then, still on your local machine, download the SQLite file from your cluster and run `duc`.

    rsync -v --progress username@beluga.calculcanada.ca:/project/.duc_databases/def-professor.sqlite  .
    duc gui -d ./def-professor.sqlite  /project/def-professor

This immediately leads to a smoother and more satisfying browsing experience.

## Space and file count usage per user on Cedar {#space_and_file_count_usage_per_user_on_cedar}

On Cedar, it is possible for any member of a group to run `diskusage_report` with the following options `--per_user` and `--all_users` to have the breakdown per user. The first option displays only heavy users. In other terms, members of the group who have more files and/or occupy more space. When both options are used, the command gives the breakdown for all members of the group. This is a handy command that helps to identify the users within a group who have more files and/or a large amount of data and ask them to better manage their data by reducing their file count usage for example.

In the following example, user `<b>`{=html}user01`</b>`{=html} runs the command and gets the following output:

``` bash
[user01@cedar1 ~]$ diskusage_report --per_user --all_users
                             Description                Space           # of files
                     /home (user user01)             109k/50G              12/500k
                  /scratch (user user01)             4000/20T              1/1000k
                 /project (group user01)              0/2048k               0/1025
          /project (group def-professor)            9434G/10T            497k/500k

This group has 8 users and the above output shows clearly that at least 4 of them have a large number of files for a small amount of data:
