`<languages />`{=html} `<b>`{=html}QIIME`</b>`{=html} (pronounced `<i>`{=html}chime`</i>`{=html}) stands for `<i>`{=html}Quantitative Insights Into [Microbial Ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_ecology)`</i>`{=html}, is an open-source [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) pipeline for performing [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota) analysis from raw DNA sequencing data. QIIME is designed to take users from raw sequencing data generated on [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/) or other platforms to publication-quality graphics and statistics. This includes demultiplexing and quality filtering, [OTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit) picking, taxonomic assignment, phylogenetic reconstruction, diversity analyses and visualizations. QIIME has been applied to studies based on billions of sequences from tens of thousands of samples.

`<b>`{=html}Note`</b>`{=html}: QIIME 2 has replaced QIIME 1 as of January 1, 2018; version 1 is no longer supported.

`<b>`{=html}Note`</b>`{=html}: As of February 2020, due to various issues generated by Conda environments on our HPC systems, `<b>`{=html}installation using Anaconda or Miniconda is no longer supported`</b>`{=html}.

## QIIME2 as a module {#qiime2_as_a_module}

QIIME2 is available in our environment via a module which wraps around a container. To know which versions are available, run

After loading the module, you can run

### Minimal Example {#minimal_example}

A minimal example of a job submission script:

## Installation

QIIME2 can be installed using [Apptainer](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Apptainer "Apptainer"){.wikilink} or [EasyBuild](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/EasyBuild "EasyBuild"){.wikilink}. Apptainer is strongly preferred since it does not generate many thousands of files in your /home directory, potentially causing you to exceed the disk quota limit on the number of files.

### Using Apptainer {#using_apptainer}

The QIIME2 developers publish images on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/qiime2). In order to use one of these images on our systems, you must first build an Apptainer image:

This build step may take over an hour, but you only need to do this once. Save the image file (`qiime2-2021.11.sif` in this example) for later re-use.

Then run your code as described in the [Apptainer](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Apptainer "Apptainer"){.wikilink} page. You will typically run each QIIME command in a `apptainer exec` statement:

So your [SBATCH](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Running_jobs "SBATCH"){.wikilink} script might look something like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --time=15:00:00
    #SBATCH --account=def-someuser

    apptainer exec -B $PWD:/home -B /scratch/someuser:/outputs \
      -B /project/def-somePI/someuser/path/to/inputs:/inputs qiime2-2021.11.sif \
      qiime tools import --type 'FeatureData[Sequence]' \
      --input-path /inputs/some_fastafile.fa \
      --output-path /outputs/some_output_feature.qza

    apptainer exec -B $PWD:/home -B /scratch/someuser:/outputs \
      -B /project/def-somePI/someuser/path/to/inputs:/inputs qiime2-2021.11.sif \
      qiime tools import \
      --type 'FeatureData[Taxonomy]' \
      --input-format HeaderlessTSVTaxonomyFormat \
      --input-path /inputs/some_taxonomy_file.tax \
      --output-path /outputs/some_output_ref-taxonomy.qza

    apptainer exec -B $PWD:/home -B /scratch/someuser:/outputs \
      -B /project/def-somePI/someuser/path/to/inputs:/inputs qiime2-2021.11.sif \
      qiime feature-classifier fit-classifier-naive-bayes \
      --i-reference-reads  /outputs/some_output_feature.qza \
      --i-reference-taxonomy /outputs/some_output_ref-taxonomy.qza \
      --o-classifier /outputs/some_output_classifier.qza

Note that it is important to use the [bind](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Apptainer#Bind_mounts "bind"){.wikilink} option (`-B`) with each folder you want to work with when you run programs in your container. For more information about Apptainer, you can watch this [Apptainer webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpmrfVqBowY).

On first importing data into QIIME format, you may receive an error ending with a message like this:

    Timezone offset does not match system offset: 0 != -18000. Please, check your config files.

This can be worked around by setting a time zone before invoking Apptainer:

\'UTC\' \|apptainer exec qiime2-2021.11.sif qiime tools import \... }}
