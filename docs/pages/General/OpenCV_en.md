`<languages />`{=html} [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

## CUDA

OpenCV is also available with CUDA.

where `X.Y.Z` represent the desired version.

## Extra modules {#extra_modules}

The module also contains the [extra modules (contrib)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/4.x/modules#an-overview-of-the-opencv_contrib-modules).

## Python bindings {#python_bindings}

The module contains bindings for multiple Python versions. To discover which are the compatible Python versions, run

Or search directly `<i>`{=html}opencv_python`</i>`{=html}, by running

where `X.Y.Z` represent the desired version.

### Usage

1\. Load the required modules.

where `X.Y.Z` represent the desired version.

2\. Import OpenCV.

If the command displays nothing, the import was successful.

#### Available Python packages {#available_python_packages}

Other Python packages depend on OpenCV bindings in order to be installed. OpenCV provides four different packages:

- `opencv_python`
- `opencv_contrib_python`
- `opencv_python_headless`
- `opencv_contrib_python_headless`

`grepÂ opencv`

\|result= opencv-contrib-python 4.5.5 opencv-contrib-python-headless 4.5.5 opencv-python 4.5.5 opencv-python-headless 4.5.5 }}

With the `opencv` module loaded, your package dependency for one of the OpenCV named will be satisfied.

## Use with OpenEXR {#use_with_openexr}

In order to read EXR files with OpenCV, the module must be activated through an environment variable. 1 python `<file>`{=html}}}
