Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the domain of numerical analysis and physics concerned with the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid motions using computer software.

==OpenFOAM==

A suite of open source solvers and tools for CFD, multiple versions of OpenFOAM are available as modules on our clusters.

==Fluent==

This is a commercial CFD program that is part of the Ansys package, available on our clusters though the user is required to supply a license.

==WRF==

A non-commercial program for atmospheric fluid dynamics, WRF is available as a module on our clusters.

==Lattice Boltzmann techniques==
(available later)

==Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics==
