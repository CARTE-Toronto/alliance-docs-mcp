[GNU Octave](https://octave.org/) is a scientific programming language that has a Powerful mathematics-oriented syntax with built-in 2D/3D plotting and visualization tools. It is free and open-source software (FOSS) and is Drop-in compatible with many [MATLAB](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/MATLAB "MATLAB"){.wikilink} scripts.

## Running Octave code {#running_octave_code}

Consider the following example code:

Here is a simple Slurm script that you can use to run `octave_2d_plot.m`:

Note that Octave relies on the Gnuplot package to generate plots.

### Running MATLAB code {#running_matlab_code}

Octave can often be used as a drop-in replacement for running MATLAB scripts, like the `cosplot.m` example on our [MATLAB](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/MATLAB#Running_a_MATLAB_code "MATLAB"){.wikilink} page:
