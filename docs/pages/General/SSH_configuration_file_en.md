On Linux and macOS, you can modify your local SSH configuration file to change the default behaviour of `ssh` and simplify the login procedure. For example, if you want to log into `narval.alliancecan.ca` as `username` using an [SSH key](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Using_SSH_keys_in_Linux "SSH key"){.wikilink}, you may need to use the following command:

To avoid having to type this command each time you want to connect to Narval, add the following to `~/.ssh/config` on your local machine:

` Host narval`\
`   User username`\
`   HostName narval.alliancecan.ca`\
`   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_private_key`

You can now log into Narval by typing

This also changes the behaviour of `sftp`, `scp`, and `rsync` and you can now [ transfer files](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Transferring_data " transfer files"){.wikilink} by typing for example

If you frequently log into different clusters, modify the above `Host` block as follows instead of adding individual entries for each cluster separately:

` Host narval beluga graham cedar`\
`   [...]`\
`   HostName %h.alliancecan.ca`\
`   [...]`

Note that you need to install your public [ SSH key](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/SSH_Keys " SSH key"){.wikilink} on each cluster separately or use [CCDB](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/SSH_Keys#Using_CCDB "CCDB"){.wikilink}.

Note that other options of the `ssh` commands have corresponding parameters that you can put in your `~/.ssh/config` file on your machine. In particular, the command line options

- `-X` (X11 forwarding)
- `-Y` (trusted X11 forwarding)
- `-A` (agent forwarding)

can be set through your configuration file by adding lines with

- `ForwardX11 yes`
- `ForwardX11Trusted yes`
- `ForwardAgent yes`

in the corresponding sections of your configuration file. However, we do not recommend doing so in general, for these reasons:

- Enabling X11 forwarding by default for all of your connections can slow down your sessions, especially if your X11 client on your computer is misconfigured.
- Enabling trusted X11 forwarding comes with a risk. Should the server to which you are connecting to be compromised, a privileged user (`root`) could intercept keyboard activity on your local computer. Use trusted X11 forwarding `<i>`{=html}only when you need it`</i>`{=html}.
- Similarly, while forwarding your SSH agent is convenient and more secure than typing a password on a remote computer, it also comes with a risk. Should the server to which you are connecting to be compromised, a privileged user (`root`) could use your agent and connect to another host without your knowledge. Use agent forwarding `<i>`{=html}only when you need it`</i>`{=html}. We also recommend that, if you use this feature, you should combine it with `ssh-askpass` so that any use of your SSH agent triggers a prompt on your computer, preventing usage of your agent without your knowledge.
