*MuJoCo stands for **Mu**lti-**Jo**int dynamics with **Co**ntact. It is a physics engine aiming to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, and other areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed.[^1]*

It is frequently used with the associated Python bindings `mujoco` as an environment for reinforcement learning (RL) research.

The module contains MuJoCo C/C++ library and its Python bindings.
