Research data management is a crucial aspect of the data lifecycle and ensures that data is discoverable, accessible and reusable during and following the completion of a project. In Canada, the Alliance is tasked with:

*Developing a national research data culture
*Fostering a community of practice for research data
*Building national research data services and infrastructure

...to better support academic researchers and institutions in building capacities and managing their data assets. To learn more or receive support with your research data management contact the Alliance directly, or speak to your local regional partner and they will get you connected.
