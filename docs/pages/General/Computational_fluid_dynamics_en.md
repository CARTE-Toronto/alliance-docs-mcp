[Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) is the domain of numerical analysis and physics concerned with the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid motions using computer software.

## OpenFOAM

A suite of open source solvers and tools for CFD, multiple versions of [OpenFOAM](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/OpenFOAM "OpenFOAM"){.wikilink} are available as modules on our clusters.

## Fluent

This is a commercial CFD program that is part of the [Ansys](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Ansys "Ansys"){.wikilink} package, available on our clusters though the user is required to supply a license.

## WRF

A non-commercial program for atmospheric fluid dynamics, [WRF](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/WRF "WRF"){.wikilink} is available as a module on our clusters.
