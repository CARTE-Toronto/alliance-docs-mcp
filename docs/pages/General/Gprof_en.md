# GNU Profiler (gprof) {#gnu_profiler_gprof}

## What is gprof? {#what_is_gprof}

[gprof](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/) is a profiling software which collects information and compiles statistics on your code. Generally, it searches for functions and subroutines in your program and inserts timing instructions for each one. Executing such a modified program creates a raw data file which can be interpreted by gprof and turned into profiling statistics.

[gprof](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/) comes with the GNU compiler suite and is available with the `gcc` module on our clusters.

## Preparing your application {#preparing_your_application}

### Loading the GNU compiler {#loading_the_gnu_compiler}

Load the appropriate GNU compiler. For example, for GCC:

### Compiling your code {#compiling_your_code}

To get useful information from [gprof](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/), you first need to compile your code with debugging information enabled. With the GNU compilers, you do so by adding the `-pg` option to the compilation command. This option tells the compiler to generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis. Without this option, no call-graph data will be gathered and you may get the following error:

    gprof: gmon.out file is missing call-graph data

### Executing your code {#executing_your_code}

Once your code has been compiled with the proper options, you then execute it:

You should run your code the same way as you would without gprof profiling; the execution line does not change. Once the binary has been executed and finished without any errors, a new file `gmon.out` is created in the current working directory. Note that if your code changes the current directory, `gmon.out` will be created in the new working directory, insofar as your program has sufficient permissions to do so.

### Getting the profiling data {#getting_the_profiling_data}

In this step the gprof tool is executed with the binary name and the above mentioned `gmon.out` as argument; the analysis file is created with all the desired profiling information.
