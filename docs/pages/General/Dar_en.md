The [`dar`](http://dar.linux.free.fr) (stands for Disk ARchive) utility was written from the ground up as a modern replacement to the classical Unix `tar` tool. First released in 2002, `dar` is open source, is actively maintained, and can be compiled on any Unix-like system.

Similar to `tar`, `dar` supports full / differential / incremental backups. Unlike `tar`, each `dar` archive includes a file index for fast file access and restore \-- this is especially useful for large archives! `dar` has built-in compression on a file-by-file basis, making it more resilient against data corruption, and you can optionally tell it not to compress already highly compressed files such as `mp4` and `gz`. `dar` supports strong encryption, can split archives at 1-byte resolution, supports extended file attributes, sparse files, hard and symbolic (soft) links, can detect data corruption in both headers and saved data and recover with minimal data loss, and has many other desirable features. On the [`dar` page](http://dar.linux.free.fr) you can find a [detailed feature-by-feature `tar`-to-`dar` comparison](http://dar.linux.free.fr/doc/FAQ.html#tar).

## Where to find `dar` {#where_to_find_dar}

On our clusters, `dar` is available on `/cvmfs`. With [StdEnv/2020](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Standard_software_environments "StdEnv/2020"){.wikilink}:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ which dar
/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/gentoo/2020/usr/bin/dar
[user_name@localhost]$ dar --version
dar version 2.5.11, Copyright (C) 2002-2052 Denis Corbin
...
```

## Using `dar` manually {#using_dar_manually}

### Basic archiving and extracting {#basic_archiving_and_extracting}

Let\'s say, in the current directory you have a subdirectory `test`. To pack it into an archive, you can type in the current directory:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -w -c all -g test
```

This will create an archive file `all.1.dar`, where `all` is the base name and `1` is the slice number. You can break a single archive into multiple slices (below). You can include multiple directories and files into an archive, e.g.

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -w -c all -g testDir1 -g testDir2 -g file1 -g file2
```

Please note that all paths should be relative to the current directory.

To list the archive\'s contents, use only the base name:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -l all
```

To extract a single file into a subdirectory `restore`, use the base name and the file path:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -R restore/ -O -w -x all -v -g test/filename
```

The flag `-O` will tell `dar` to ignore file ownership. Wrong ownership would be a problem if you are restoring someone else\'s files and you are not root. However, even if you are restoring your own files, `dar` will throw a message that you are doing this as non-root and will ask you to confirm. To disable this warning, use `-O`. The flag `-w` will disable a warning if `restore/test` already exists.

To extract an entire directory, type:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -R restore/ -O -w -x all -v -g test
```

Similar to creating an archive, you can pass multiple directories and files by using multiple `-g` flags. Note that `dar` does not accept Unix wild masks after `-g`.

#### A note about the Lustre filesystem {#a_note_about_the_lustre_filesystem}

If the archived files are coming from a [Lustre filesystem](https://www.lustre.org/) (typically in `/home`, `/project` or `/scratch` on [our *general-purpose* compute clusters](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/National_systems "our general-purpose compute clusters"){.wikilink}), some `<i>`{=html}extended attributes`</i>`{=html} are saved automatically. To see which extended attributes are assigned to each archived file, use the `-alist-ea` flag:

We can see strings like: `Extended Attribute: [lustre.lov]`. With this attribute, any file extraction to a location formatted in Lustre will still work as usual. But if one tries to extract files to the [node local storage](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Using_node-local_storage "node local storage"){.wikilink} (also known as `$SLURM_TMPDIR`), the extraction will show error messages like: `Error while adding EA lustre.lov : Operation not supported`.

To avoid these error messages, the `-u` flag can be used to exclude a specific type of attribute, while the \"affected\" files are still extracted. For example:

Another solution is to get rid of the `lustre.lov` attribute while creating the archive with the same `-u` flag:

In conclusion, this is necessary only if you intend to extract files to a location not formatted in Lustre.

### Incremental backups {#incremental_backups}

You can create differential and incremental backups with `dar`, by passing the base name of the reference archive with `-A`. For example, let\'s say on Monday you create a full backup named `monday`:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -w -c monday -g test
```

On Tuesday you modify some of the files and then include only these files into a new, incremental backup named `tuesday`, using the `monday` archive as a reference:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -w -A monday -c tuesday -g test
```

On Wednesday you modify more files, and at the end of the day you create a new backup named `wednesday`, now using the `tuesday` archive as a reference:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -w -A tuesday -c wednesday -g test
```

Now you have three files:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ ls *.dar
monday.1.dar     tuesday.1.dar    wednesday.1.dar
```

The file `wednesday.1.dar` contains only the files that you modified on Wednesday, but not the files from Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, the command

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -R restore -O -x wednesday
```

will only restore files that were modified on Wednesday. To restore everything, you have to go through all backups in the chronological order:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -R restore -O -w -x monday      # restore the full backup
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -R restore -O -w -x tuesday     # restore the first incremental backup
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -R restore -O -w -x wednesday   # restore the second incremental backup
```

### Limiting the size of each slice {#limiting_the_size_of_each_slice}

To limit the maximum size of each slice in bytes, use the flag `-s` followed by a number and one of k/M/G/T. For example, for a 1340 MB archive, the command

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -s 100M -w -c monday -g test
```

will create 14 slices named `monday.{1..14}.dar`. To extract from all of these, use their base name:

``` console
[user_name@localhost]$ dar -O -x monday
```

## External scripts {#external_scripts}

One of our team members has written bash functions that can facilitate the use of `dar`. You can use these functions as inspiration to write your own scripts. See [here](https://github.com/razoumov/sharedSnippets) for details.
