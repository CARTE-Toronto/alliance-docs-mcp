`<languages />`{=html} An annual account renewal process takes place typically in the spring, as this is a critical process ensuring that:

1.  Accounts that are no longer needed are deactivated; and
2.  Information that funding agencies and partners require is collected for reporting purposes.

The information we collect about researchers and their results is important for reports to funding agencies and the digital research infrastructure (DRI) ecosystem.

If you have an active account, we will send you an email during the account renewal period directing you to our account renewal form.

**Deactivation of Accounts**

If users let their CCDB account expire, they will be no longer able to login into any of our systems.

If a Principal Investigator (PI) allows their account to expire, their account as well as the account of all those users that they sponsor will also be deactivated.

Accounts can be reactivated at any time by logging into [CCDB](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/) and completing the account renewal form.

Users that do not want to renew their CCDB account but still want to recover their files can request a temporary extension by sending an email to support@tech.alliancecan.ca.

You can find more information about account renewals on our [Account Renewals FAQ page](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/Account_renewal_FAQ "Account Renewals FAQ page"){.wikilink} or by contacting renewals@tech.alliancecan.ca.
